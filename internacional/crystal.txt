We're like crystal, we break easy
I'm a poor man if you leave me
I'm applauded, then forgotten
It was Summer, now it's Autumn

I don't know what to say
You don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage
With a girl I betrayed
Here comes love, it's like honey
You can't buy it with money
You're not alone anymore
Shock me to the core
You shock me to the core

We're like crystal, it's not easy
With your love you could feed me
Every man and every woman
(And every woman)
Needs someone
So keep it comin', keep it comin', keep it comin'
Keep it comin', keep it comin', keep it comin'

I don't know what to say
You don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage
With a girl I betrayed
Here comes love, it's like honey
You can't buy it with money
You're not alone anymore
Shock me to the core
You shock me to the core
